This tiny module keeps the device screen awake without requiring HTTPS or SSL certificates, making it ideal for local development. 
It keeps the screen awake by playing an extremely low-frequency, low-resolution 10 KB video in the background.<br><br>

The video was generated by FFMPEG, full command:
```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "nullsrc=s=10x10:r=10,geq=random(1)*255:random(1)*255:random(1)*255" -f lavfi -i "sine=f=19000:b=10:d=5" -filter_complex "[1:a]volume=-50dB[aud]" -map 0:v -map "[aud]" -t 2.5 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac SINE19000.mp4
```

- Resolution: 10x10
- FPS: 10
- Frequency: 19kHz
- Volume reduced by: 50dB
- Duration: 2.5s

JavaScript usage:
```js
// Import the main function.
import { addS19K } from "https://xzripper.github.io/S19K.js";

// Add S19K on the page
addS19K();
```

That's it!
